## [Where does it start?](./init/README.md)

This project is a hack, I just wanted to learn `Logic Programming on Scala` and found [Tarrau](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~tarau/)'s code. I just gave it a ride.

## [Is the code running?](./styla/README.md)

Yes, I created an `sbt` makefile and was able to get to the Prolog REPL
